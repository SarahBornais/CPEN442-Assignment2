Things we know (or probably know) about this cipher:
- Symmetry mapping: pairs have swapped encryption/decryption (e.g. if AB->CD, then BA->DC)
- Know COMXMA should be encrypted in multiple places in the ciphertext
    - Will see the encoded versions of both MX and XM depending on where the digraph split occurs
    - Maybe the most common mirrored pair in the ciphertext is MX/XM encoded
    - The most common mirrored pair is VW/WV
    - However, neither appear in the most common 6 letter strings, which we would expect
- Fairly likely that the code word doesn't have Z in it, so Z is likely in box 25 of the key
- Also about a 50% chance the last letter of the plaintext is X, since we add that if the plaintext character length was odd
- Missing letter J in the ciphertext, so J/I are combined in the key
- Have about 600 possible digraphs, or about 300 if we don't care about letter order
- Should have a higher proportion of X occurrences in the plaintext, since we split double letters with it
- If we see double letters in our attempted decryption, then our attempted decryption is wrong
- A letter/pair will NEVER map to itself or its mirror
